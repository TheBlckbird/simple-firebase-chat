# Simple Chat with Firebase
You need a Firebase project with a Realtime Database and optionally Hosting.

You also have to add your firebase connection details in `src/firebaseConfigExample.js` and rename the file to `firebaseConfig.js`.

This project uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for packing.
